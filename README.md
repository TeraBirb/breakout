# Breakout
## A recreation of the classic arcade game Breakout by Atari using Java and Objectdraw API
###### Author: Isaiah C April, 2022 for CIS 36A: Java Programming course

There are two ways to run the game:

Download Breakout.jar from the latest release. Using the Java command line tool, run:
```console
java -jar Breakout.jar
```
(Alternative way) 
1. Clone or Fork a copy of this repository.
2. Open the repository using your favorite Java IDE.
3. Using your IDE, build and run the project.

A popup window will appear and the game starts. Be quick! I haven't made a start button or countdown yet (soon to come!). Click on the window to make your paddle appear and drag to move. Don't let the ball fall to the bottom! You have three lives. You win if you get all bricks.

Have fun,

###### Isaiah
